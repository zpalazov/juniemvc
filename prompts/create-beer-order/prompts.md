Analyze the image in `prompts/create-beer-order/beers_erd.png`. Create detailed instructions to implement the relationships
in JPA entities.

----------------------------------------------------

Analyze `prompts/create-beer-order/requirements-draft.md` and inspect the project. Improve and rewrite the draft requirements to
a new file called `prompts/create-beer-order/requirements.md`. The new requirements should be clear, concise, and complete.

-----------------------------------------------------

Analyze `prompts/create-beer-order/requirements.md` and create a detailed implementation plan to add DTOs to the project.
Write the plan to a new file called `prompts/create-beer-order/plan.md`. The plan should include steps.

-----------------------------------------------------

Create a detailed enumerated task list to implement the plan in `prompts/create-beer-order/plan.md`. Task items should have a
placeholder [] for marking completion. Write the task list to a new file called `prompts/create-beer-order/tasks.md`.

------------------------------------------------------

Complete the tasks in `prompts/create-beer-order/tasks.md` one by one, updating the project code as needed. After completing each
task, mark it as done by replacing [] with [x]. After all tasks are done, ensure the project compiles and tests pass.
